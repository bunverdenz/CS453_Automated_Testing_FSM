                                <p>The Little Mermaid by Hans Christian Andersen</p>

                                <p>Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as
                                    clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom
                                    it: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground
                                    beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King and his
                                    subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but
                                    bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most singular flowers and plants grow there; the
                                    leaves and stems of which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water
                                    causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide between
                                    the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land. In the deepest spot of
                                    all, stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long
                                    gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open
                                    and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in
                                    each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen.

                                <p>The Odyssey by Homer</p>
                                <p>Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had
                                    sacked the famous town of Troy.
                                    Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs
                                    he was acquainted; moreover
                                    he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely
                                    home; but do what he might he
                                    could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating
                                    the cattle of the Sun-god
                                    Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all
                                    these things, oh daughter
                                    of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.</p>
                                <p>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except
                                    Ulysses, and he, though he was
                                    longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who
                                    had got him into a large
                                    cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods
                                    settled that he should go
                                    back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles
                                    were not yet over;
                                    nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still
                                    persecuted him without ceasing and
                                    would not let him get home</p>

                                <p>The range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly
                                    short lifetime of a nucleus
                                    to the age of the Earth, from the tiny sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast
                                    distance to the edges of the
                                    known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth
                                    and the Sun, there are
                                    enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced
                                    scientist. Giving numerical
                                    values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to
                                    understand nature much more
                                    deeply than does qualitative description alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we
                                    must also have accepted
                                    units in which to express them. And we shall find that (even in the potentially
                                    mundane discussion of meters,
                                    kilograms, and seconds) a profound simplicity of nature appears—all physical
                                    quantities can be expressed as
                                    combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities: length, mass, time, and
                                    electric current.</p>

                                <p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p>
                                <p>- Compare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and
                                    methods of study</p>
                                <p>- Discuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology</p>
                                <p>Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these
                                    structures are very small and can
                                    only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger
                                    structures can readily be seen,
                                    manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that
                                    means “to cut apart.” Human
                                    anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the
                                    wounds of soldiers and other
                                    injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment
                                    their knowledge. When a body
                                    is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical
                                    attributes and their relationships
                                    to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in
                                    pathology labs. In order to
                                    observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have
                                    been developed. These
                                    techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a
                                    cancerous tumor or a
                                    fractured bone.</p>

                                <p>- How did the first galaxies in the universe form, and did they make the universe
                                    transparent to light?</p>
                                <p>- How did later galaxies produce and disperse into the universe the heavier elements
                                    that are the building
                                    blocks of stars, planets, and even humans?</p>
                                <p>These questions will be addressed in some of the first observations made by the Webb
                                    telescope, slated to
                                    launch in March 2021. These observations will be part of the Director's
                                    Discretionary-Early Release Science
                                    program, which provides time to selected projects early in the telescope's mission.
                                    This program allows the
                                    astronomical community to quickly learn how best to use Webb's capabilities, while
                                    also yielding robust
                                    science.</p>

                                    investigating how Webb can tackle these two key questions about the universe in the

                                    today in the International
                                    Journal of Science Education.</p>

                                    science knowledge from
                                    pre-test to post-test, and English language learners increased 15 percentage points.
                                    Pupils taught the same
                                    content with traditional methods, such as textbooks, showed only 5-point gains.</p>

           <p>Far out in the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; so deep, indeed, that no cable could fathom it: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the ground beneath to the surface of the water above. There dwell the Sea King and his subjects. We must not imagine that there is nothing at the bottom of the sea but bare yellow sand. No, indeed; the most singular flowers and plants grow there; the leaves and stems of which are so pliant, that the slightest agitation of the water causes them to stir as if they had life. Fishes, both large and small, glide between the branches, as birds fly among the trees here upon land. In the deepest spot of all, stands the castle of the Sea King. Its walls are built of coral, and the long gothic windows are of the clearest amber. The roof is formed of shells, that open and close as the water flows over them. Their appearance is very beautiful, for in each lies a glittering pearl, which would be fit for the diadem of a queen. </p>

           <p>Tell me, O Muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, oh daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.</p> 
           <p>So now all who escaped death in battle or by shipwreck had got safely home except Ulysses, and he, though he was longing to return to his wife and country, was detained by the goddess Calypso, who had got him into a large cave and wanted to marry him. But as years went by, there came a time when the gods settled that he should go back to Ithaca; even then, however, when he was among his own people, his troubles were not yet over; nevertheless all the gods had now begun to pity him except Neptune, who still persecuted him without ceasing and would not let him get home</p>

           <p>The range of objects and phenomena studied in physics is immense. From the incredibly short lifetime of a nucleus to the age of the Earth, from the tiny sizes of sub-nuclear particles to the vast distance to the edges of the known universe, from the force exerted by a jumping flea to the force between Earth and the Sun, there are enough factors of 10 to challenge the imagination of even the most experienced scientist. Giving numerical values for physical quantities and equations for physical principles allows us to understand nature much more deeply than does qualitative description alone. To comprehend these vast ranges, we must also have accepted units in which to express them. And we shall find that (even in the potentially mundane discussion of meters, kilograms, and seconds) a profound simplicity of nature appears—all physical quantities can be expressed as combinations of only four fundamental physical quantities: length, mass, time, and electric current.</p>

           <p>By the end of this section, you will be able to:</p> 
           <p>- Compare and contrast anatomy and physiology, including their specializations and methods of study</p> 
           <p>- Discuss the fundamental relationship between anatomy and physiology</p> 
           <p>Human anatomy is the scientific study of the body’s structures. Some of these structures are very small and can only be observed and analyzed with the assistance of a microscope. Other larger structures can readily be seen, manipulated, measured, and weighed. The word “anatomy” comes from a Greek root that means “to cut apart.” Human anatomy was first studied by observing the exterior of the body and observing the wounds of soldiers and other injuries. Later, physicians were allowed to dissect bodies of the dead to augment their knowledge. When a body is dissected, its structures are cut apart in order to observe their physical attributes and their relationships to one another. Dissection is still used in medical schools, anatomy courses, and in pathology labs. In order to observe structures in living people, however, a number of imaging techniques have been developed. These techniques allow clinicians to visualize structures inside the living body such as a cancerous tumor or a fractured bone.</p>

           <p>Through the combined power of NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope and gravity creating "natural telescopes" in space, astronomers hope to answer two science questions that are fundamental to understanding the origins and evolution of the universe:</p> 
           <p>- How did the first galaxies in the universe form, and did they make the universe transparent to light?</p> 
           <p>- How did later galaxies produce and disperse into the universe the heavier elements that are the building blocks of stars, planets, and even humans?</p> 
           <p>These questions will be addressed in some of the first observations made by the Webb telescope, slated to launch in March 2021. These observations will be part of the Director's Discretionary-Early Release Science program, which provides time to selected projects early in the telescope's mission. This program allows the astronomical community to quickly learn how best to use Webb's capabilities, while also yielding robust science.</p> 
           <p>An international team led by Tommaso Treu of the University of California, Los Angeles, has been investigating how Webb can tackle these two key questions about the universe in the Early Release Science program.</p>

           <p>Web-based learning tools can help deepen science knowledge among all middle school students, and ease the science literacy gap for underachieving students, according to a three-year study published today in the International Journal of Science Education.</p> 
           <p>While all participating students improved their science knowledge, the results were particularly notable for less able students.</p> 
           <p>Students with learning disabilities improved 18 percentage points on assessments of science knowledge from pre-test to post-test, and English language learners increased 15 percentage points. Pupils taught the same content with traditional methods, such as textbooks, showed only 5-point gains.</p> 
           <p>"Well-designed instructional technology really works to lessen the science literacy gap among diverse groups of learners. Technology offers an engaging and motivating environment for learning, and we are just beginning to understand how we can use it effectively to support students with learning disabilities and English language learners.</p>
