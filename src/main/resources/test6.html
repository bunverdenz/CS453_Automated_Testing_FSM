          How to read pdf files?

         <dd> 
          <p>Software for Windows: </p> 
          <p>There are three ways to read the pdf files: </p> 
          <p>1. Open NaturalReader -&gt; click "Add new" button -&gt; click “Open (Existing Files)” to open the file;</p> 
          <p>2. Open the pdf file directly in AdobeReader, click the floating bar button of NaturalReader to switch to the floating bar, select the text in the pdf file and click "play" button; </p> 
          <p>3. If the pdf file is a scanned file or it is DRM-protected, please click “Add New” button in main screen of NaturalReader -&gt; click Capture (New Images) to capture the text from the file to read.</p> 
          <p>Software for Mac:</p> 
          <p>There are three ways to read the pdf files:</p> 
          <p>1. Open NaturalReader -&gt; click "Add new" button -&gt; click “File” to open the file;</p> 
          <p>2. Open the pdf file directly in AdobeReader, click the floating bar button of NaturalReader to switch to the floating bar, select the text in the pdf file and click "play" button;</p>

          When I press NaturalReader icon from desktop, the program open and close immediately. Why?
         </dt> 
         <dd> 
          <p>This is a license issue. The issue occurs because NaturalReader has been installed on more computers than it is allowed. To fix the problem, please find those computers, open NaturalReader - &gt; click "?" button on the upper right -&gt; deactivate serial number.&nbsp;</p>

         <dt>
          Why can’t NaturalReader read my PDF file?
         </dt> 
         <dd> 
          <p>PDFs that are not properly tagged for accessibility cannot be accessed by speech synthesizers since there is no information embedded in the file for the program to properly interpret and read out. There are various types of PDF files, depending on where they originated. Digitally created PDFs are “accessible” because there is meta-information embedded within the file that allows a speech synthesizer like NaturalReader to extract the text and read it aloud.</p> 
          <p>In contrast, “inaccessible PDFs,” “scanned PDFs,” or “image-only PDFs” are those that originated from something like a scanner or when image files are inserted into the PDF. These kinds of PDFs do not have the encoded meta-information of the text itself embedded in the file to allow a speech synthesizer to read it. It only shows the text as a snapshot-like image, with no way for a speech synthesizer to ‘know’ what characters are actually in the document. This is why you cannot edit certain PDF files, unlike text from word processor applications like MS Word. Speech synthesizers by themselves can only read direct text, not images of text.</p> 
          <p>For documents that contain images, you would need the OCR (optical character recognition) feature to first convert it into a readable file. This feature is available unlimitedly with NaturalReader Online’s Web Premium plan and with the NaturalReader Ultimate version software. It is also available with limitations (up to 500 images) with NaturalReader Professional. </p>

         </dt> 
         <dd> 
          <p>We strongly recommend that all customers try before you buy. We provide a free 7-day trial version to let you fully evaluate our NaturalReader Commercial application before you make a purchase decision. Please take advantage of the trial version to make sure that NaturalReader Commercial meets your needs before purchasing a license. You have no obligations to purchase and you won’t be asked to provide any payment information until you decide to buy.</p> 
          <p>If you purchase one of our plans, after your payment has cleared you will receive an email with the order information. Once this confirmation is emailed to you, no refunds will be given. We have this policy because service begins as soon as your initial payment is processed and it would be impossible for you to return your generated audio files of licensed voices.</p> 
          <p>By placing an order for a NaturalReader Commercial subscription, you indicate that you have read this refund policy and that you agree with and fully accept the terms of this refund policy.</p> 
          <p>If you do not agree with or fully accept the terms of this refund policy, we ask that you do not place an order with us.</p> 
          <p>If you no longer wish to subscribe to NaturalReader Commercial, you can turn off the licensing auto-renewal from the Billing Settings. Your account will continue to be active until the end of your billing cycle.</p>

          I’m trying to upload a document, but the app keeps crashing.
         </dt> 
         <dd> 
          <p>Please double-check the file format to ensure it is compatible with NaturalReader. If it is a PDF causing the issue, it is likely because it contains images with inaccessible text. If the PDF is not embedded with accessible text for images, the app cannot access the proper information to read it.</p> 
          <p>PDFs that are not properly tagged for accessibility cannot be accessed by speech synthesizers since there is no information embedded in the file for the program to properly interpret and read out. Speech synthesizers can only read text and not images that contain text. However our desktop version of the software comes equipped with OCR (optical character recognition), which is capable of importing such types of PDF files.</p>

          <p>The web browser feature is a built-in browser for easy web viewing.

          Why can’t NaturalReader read my PDF file?
         </dt> 
         <dd> 
          <p>PDFs that are not properly tagged for accessibility cannot be accessed by speech synthesizers since there is no information embedded in the file for the program to properly interpret and read out. There are various types of PDF files, depending on where they originated. Digitally created PDFs are “accessible” because there is meta-information embedded within the file that allows a speech synthesizer like NaturalReader to extract the text and read it aloud.</p> 
          <p>In contrast, “inaccessible PDFs,” “scanned PDFs,” or “image-only PDFs” are those that originated from something like a scanner or when image files are inserted into the PDF. These kinds of PDFs do not have the encoded meta-information of the text itself embedded in the file to allow a speech synthesizer to read it. It only shows the text as a snapshot-like image, with no way for a speech synthesizer to ‘know’ what characters are actually in the document. This is why you cannot edit certain PDF files, unlike text from word processor applications like MS Word. Speech synthesizers by themselves can only read direct text, not images of text.</p> 
          <p>For documents that contain images, you would need the OCR (optical character recognition) feature to first convert it into a readable file. This feature is not available with NaturalReader Pro, but is available with select NaturalReader desktop versions.

         <dd> 
          <p>This issue is most likely caused by the special encoding of the file. Though the words as they appear on the page might look normal, sometimes the hidden encoding of the file itself contains various complicated and hidden encoding that affects the reading of the document. However most files with standard encoding are supported and will be read correctly.</p>

           As a parent of a struggling Middle School student with Dyslexia, reading has always been a challenge. We use Natural Reader software and the MP3 export feature almost daily to help him get through lengthy reading assignments and to help create study material he can listen to on his IPOD. Natural Reader has been instrumental in helping him to excel in school! While reading to learn, he can now focus on learning the material at hand rather than being distracted by his reading challenges. He is now an Honor Roll student who has made tremendous progress since utilizing Natural Reader. We highly recommend Natural Reader for any student who has difficulties with reading.

           As Computer Science and Engineering student I have to spend most of my time in front of the PC programming or reading slides full of formulas. This makes my eyes totally tired and I simply do not feel like reading afterwards. On the other hand, at the end of the day I long for diversity e.g. by a great novel or some motivational material. With NaturalReader I easily turn inspirational and self-improvement literature into mp3s and listen to them on the long way back home from the university. This helps me keep the balance between professional and soft skills.The multiple voices support is an amazing feature and the German language starts to sound really nice when spoken by Sarah.

           I purchased Natural Reader for my daughter many years ago. The program is a great aid for children with language-based learning disabilities and helped my daughter immensely in preparing the myriad written assignments that were part of her education in her specialized school. She has now taken the program to college with her where she continues to use it. Recently I purchased a program upgrade which I am sharing with my elderly father who has age-related macular degeneration. He enjoys using his computer and has been struggling with low vision. Natural Reader is allowing him to listen to pages on the internet, alleviating his struggles trying to read from the computer screen with a magnifying glass.

What I like the most about the software is the interface, because of my bad eyesight I had to increase the font, it makes reading more fun and pleasurable

           "I discovered NaturalReader after hearing that it was possible to have text from the computer read aloud to you. I have Aspergers' Syndrome, which is an autistic spectrum learning difficulty. I love to gather information, learn and research things on the internet, with current technology more and more information is digital rather than in a book, I use NaturalReader to read aloud passages from ebooks I have bought, PDF documents, webpages with lots of text, and to read back to me things I have typed to 'hear them'. This helps me greatly as although I am a visual/kinetic learner, words are not pictures. NaturalReader allows me to hear all the text I would otherwise have had to read on the screen, allowing me to create a mental image of what I am hearing, this helps me process and have a better retainment of information. The quality of the voices available, the ability to adjust the speed of speech is brilliant. I have three voices installed on the computer but my favourite by far is 'US - Heather', it is pleasant to listen to and is really easy to understand. Natural Reader helps me to learn and listen to texts of interest without having eyestrain or eye discomfort from reading the words. It is also really nice to have someone read to you, it uses a lot less energy and focus. The ability to copy text from places online and create audio files to listen to on an MP3 player or music player is fantastic, it allows me to go anywhere and do anything instead of sitting in front of a computer screen. The feature that allows you type your own text and have that read to is a great way to check accuracy or how it 'sounds'. All in all I would have to say that NaturalReader is one of the best pieces of software I have ever bought, and stands alone in quality and value for money.

           NaturalReader has been a transformational and liberating product for me. As someone that suffers from a learning disability, having this product to proof my emails, presentations and contracts, has allowed me to become more independent and not have the burden to rely on someone to proof my work. I now create my document, and have NaturalReader read back the contents of what I wrote, thus it allows me to listen to what I actually wrote, and not what I think I wrote. It has given me additional confidence and generated increased capacity, as I am more secure in my work products and have the ability to get work done faster. There have been a few times since purchasing this product where I had to switch laptops, and for brief periods of time where I did not have access to the product, I was completely lost without the product on my laptop. I really have to say thank you and I cannot express enough the impact this product has had on my life.

           I’ve been using Natural Reader for years; it is invaluable when it comes to proofreading my work. I’ve had multiple papers published in medical journals and I write academic textbooks; on one textbook, Natural Reader enabled me to catch more than 80 typos that eluded copy editors and proofreaders. Thanks to Natural Reader, the typos, which would have distracted the reader who is trying to comprehend a concept, are gone. 
          <br> Natural Reader also helps with my dyslexia; if I invert, misplace, or leave out a word, it would be difficult for me to visually proofread that, however, when Natural Reader speaks, my typos stand out, and virtually scream for correction. 
          <br> I also find Natural Reader useful for reading lengthy papers and e-mails. This is among the finest piece of software I own.

           Natural Reader software has made a great difference for my work as a freelance translator and editor. Before getting your software, I was always in trouble when trying to cross-check my translation with the original work. Natural Reader allows me to listen and concentrate on the written material and spared me the trouble of reading texts sentence by sentence, which is a very tedious and inefficient way of editing. But now it is different. I am at ease in detecting and correcting inaccuracies, which will render good translation pieces that meet the best of my clients' satisfaction. I strongly recommend translators to use your invaluable software.

           I heard about Natural Reader from a friend who uses it to proof read her Reports before sending them out. I downloaded a trial version and then almost immediately realised I had found one of the most valuable tools I had come across. I am an author, writing books as well as newspaper and website Horoscopes content for companies around the world and quality is essential for my business. While I have a proof reader who proof reads my content, I now use Natural Reader as the final step in the proofing process. There is nothing like hearing what you have written out loud and reading it myself I tend to see or read what I expect to see, missing mistakes. With Natural Reader I not only pick up any mistakes that have been missed, it gives me a good sense of the natural flow of what I have written. I can't recommend this highly enough. My son is a motoring journalist and I have even converted him to Natural Reader.

           Almost all of my work is online and in addition to that I run two websites. Some days my eyes just feel exhausted. I devour audiobooks but I'm also sent a lot of ebooks as I'm a reviewer. NaturalReader allows me to enjoy them without being glued to the screen or an eReader. I can enjoy the story and rest my eyes. I upgraded to a paid version because I was so impressed with the voices - it's made my reading experience so much easier. If I have a deadline for a review and I've been glued to a screen all day, I can still get a break this way. It's ideal.

If you write novels or other works of fiction or non-fiction, natural reader would definitely help your craft. It would be tremendously helpful for students of any ages who can use a computer to express themselves and hear their written expression spoken back to them. It improves spelling, grammar, punctuation etc. Any professional who writes and publishes articles (research or otherwise) can benefit by employing natural reader. On top of all of these benefits, you can also turn all your text documents into audio mp3 files to play back when and where you wish.

I help edit and sometimes co-author online courses developed by hundreds of professors. NaturalReader has cut my editing time in half! Now when I edit, I read as NaturalReader recites to me what is on the webpages. Mistakes are easily caught. Hearing NaturalReader enables me to listen for activities worded awkwardly so re-writes can be accomplished before publication. The reader also helps me to keep up with all the educational articles that are forwarded to me by colleagues. When will the NaturalReader IPAD app be coming out?

          <p>Natural reader has an amazing natural speaking quality. It is not just that the voice is not robotic: There are no disturbing clic and pop artifacts and intonation is such, that it is difficult to tell it is not a human speaking. Listening this speech is pleasant and relaxing. I don't even need to make any modification into the written text that in input to Natural Reader to get this astonishing quality.</p> 
          <p>I convert my eBooks to MP3 (using Natural Reader) and then listen at night, when I close my eyes. Or whenever I can free my attention, but not my hands and my eyes.</p> 
          <p>I have the English and French voice modules and have tested Spanish. I've found excellent voices from the large supplementary choice provided for each language. Gerardo Murillo Technical Consultant, Valbonne, France</p>

           I am extremely pleased with my purchase of Natural Reader. I work nights and find it important to keep my mind occupied so I listen to audio books. I find the voices very listenable and "natural". The software itself is very easy to understand and use and the pronunciation editor is a great tool. Thanks so much I am seldom so enthusiastic about a software purchase.
