      Our platform aims to support all in all 3 tasks:
     <br>
     <br> 1. Submission of lyrics, where you can submit lyrics to receive a complementing melody for it. Just click on ‘submit lyrics’ button and write your lyrics as well as the general direction you want the song to take!
     <br> 2. Compose melody to submitted lyrics. Now that there are lyrics, we need to acquire a melody! Using crowdsourcing, we seek to gather input from variety of people and join their suggestions together to compose ‘the melody’ for the lyrics submitted.
     <br> 3. Lastly, we want you to have fun freely experimenting with notes and melody composition, not just doing it according to the lyrics!

      Aggregation is the most important part of our platform. Once we have the data from tens of people, we need a way to acquire the final product. We decided to, as mentioned above, open a small section of the song at a time to be composed. After enough users have participated, we take the highest chosen notes as the melody, and go on to the next section.This is because we wanted you to have freedom and a feeling that you are ‘composing’, while maintaining a coherent flow of sound. By limiting the section we take input for, we hope to see a common pattern that represent the sound of the crowd.
     <br> While doing so, we wanted our composition process to be interactive so that you can take inspiration from others and provide inspiration to others. By ticking the "see what others have done" button, you will be able to see the distribution of popular notes that have been voted so far. Of course, if you want to be fully independent in your composition, feel free to tick out the box and explore on your own.

      Now the third task is not something that requires quality control. Lyrics and melody composition, however, requires proper control if we are to get a good result. For the lyric submission, inappropriate words can be flagged, which would result in manual review of the lyrics, and removal if deemed necessary. Imposing quality control on composing is a bit more complicated; after all, music is very subjective. We thought we would try to acquire the sound of the crowd from the inputs of various users by taking the average of the user input small segment of the song at a time: simply put, users will work at a small part of the lyrics at one time, and we think by controlling the length of the segment and time, we will be able to reduce ‘trolling’ inputs. More details of this are available below at Aggregation.

      The result should be a whole coherent song. By which I mean a sequence of notes that match with the syllables of the lyrics. We do not provide a feature that converts these notes into vocals. The most popular and or recently finished songs can be viewed in the gallery tab. One can also experiment on completed songs from the gallery tab; changes made in this manner will not be saved in the official release of the song.
