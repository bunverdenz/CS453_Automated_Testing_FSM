        </div> </li> 
       <li id="personal-use"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What languages are supported?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>This depends on what kind of device you're using as well as your subscription plan. Specific Free Voices available will vary depending on whether you're using a Windows or Mac computer. Free users can also use the Premium Voices for 20 minutes per day. </p> 
         <p>Premium subscribers have unlimited access to both the Free Voices and Premium Voices. No access to Plus Voices is included. </p>

       <li id="compare"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I use NaturalReader Online to read from webpages?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Yes, you can download the NaturalReader Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store in the link below so you can read from webpages or GoogleDocs:</p> 
         <p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en-US">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en-US</a> </p> 
         <p>Like the main NR Online application, free users can use the Free Voices unlimitedly, the Premium Voices for 20 minutes per day, and the Plus Voices for 5 minutes per day.</p> 
         <p>Unlimited use of the Plus Voices come with a Plus subscription only. Plus Voices are now also available to use in the NaturalReader Chrome Extension.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li id="character-limit"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What voices are available to use with the Chrome Extension?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Just like the main NR Online application, the Chrome Extension offers Free Voices, Premium Voices, and Plus Voices. The amount of daily access to the voice lists will also depend on your user status.</p> 
         <p>You can download the NR Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store here:</p> 
         <p><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en-US">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/natural-reader-text-to-sp/kohfgcgbkjodfcfkcackpagifgbcmimk?hl=en-US</a> </p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is the cost of NaturalReader Online?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>NR Online is available through subscription only with both yearly and monthly plans available:</p> 
         <p>Premium (monthly): $9.99 USD/ month </p> 
         <p>Premium (yearly): $59.88 USD/ year </p> 
         <p>Plus (monthly): $19 USD/ month </p> 
         <p>Plus (yearly): $110 USD/ year </p> 
         <p>Free users may also use the basic text-to-speech functions unlimitedly with the Free Voices and use the Premium Voices for up to 20 minutes per day. Free and Premium users may sample the Plus Voices for up to 5 minutes per day. </p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li id="discount"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's the difference between the free and paid versions? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Free users, whether registered or not, can use the basic text-to-speech function by typing in or uploading a supported accessible document using Free Voices unlimitedly. Premium Voices may be sampled for 20 minutes per day and Plus Voices for 5 minutes per day.</p> 
         <p>Free users can also download the NR Chrome Extension from the Chrome Web Store to use the Free Voices unlimitedly or the Premium Voices for 20 minutes per day.</p> 
         <p>Upgrading to a paid subscription with the Premium plan allows you unlimited use of the Premium Voices for both the main application as well as the Chrome Extension, 1 million characters for mp3 conversion per month of the subscription, and access to the OCR feature to read from inaccessible PDFs, scanned documents, images, or screenshots.</p> 
         <p>The Plus plan includes all the same features as Premium, but also unlimited access to the Plus Voices. Plus Voices include a selection of high-quality text-to-speech voices with an additional languages that are not available to use with free or Premium plans.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li id="commercial"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What's the difference between Premium and Plus?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Plus includes all the same features as Premium, which are: unlimited access to Free Voices and Premium Voices, OCR, mp3 conversion for 1 million characters per month, Pronunciation Editor, Document History, Audio List, and unlimited use of Free and Premium Voices with the NR Chrome Extension.</p> 
         <p>What's different about Plus is that it offers exclusive access to the Plus Voices, a list of high-fidelity, accuese voices which support the following languages:</p> 
         <p>English (US, UK, Australian, Indian, Welsh); Danish; Dutch; French (European, Canadian); German; Icelandic; Italian; Norwegian; Polish; Portuguese (European, Brazilian); Romanian; Russian; Spanish (European, US); Swedish; Turkish; and Welsh.</p> 
         <p>You can sample Plus Voices for up to 5 minutes per day directly from the application. You can also listen to additional samples from the demo page here:</p> 
         <p><a href="./plusvoicedemo.html" id="team6_3">https://www.naturalreaders.com/plusvoicedemo.html</a> </p> 
         <p>By upgrading from Premium to Plus, you instantly double the voices you have access to! Plus' additional voices include 3 more regional English accents and 8 more languages, giving you a total of 100+ natural high-quality voices.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li id="purchase-order"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm not interested in a subscription. Why should I register for a free account?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Even if you're not looking to upgrade to a paid account, registering would allow you access to the Pronunciation Editor and the Document History features. The Document History is where you can find all your past uploads so you can easily re-open and continue reading from your documents without having to find the original file to re-upload to the application. This is great if you use multiple devices too–if you switch to mobile or login from a different computer, you can simply continue to read by opening the document from your account's Document History.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li id="cancellation-refunds"> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> How can I order a subscription? What payment methods are available?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>You can purchase a subscription from the NR Online's product page here:</p> 
         <p> <a href="./webapp.html" id="team6_4">https://www.naturalreaders.com/webapp.html</a> </p> 
         <p>We partner with Stripe to provide secure invoicing and payments processing. We accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express payments, debit or credit. We do not accept PayPal or wire transfer for subscription services. </p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I upgrade from Premium to Plus?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>First, be sure you're logged into the NR Online application then click on ‘More’ in the top right corner (or tap ☰ in the top left if using mobile). Select 'Billing Information' and on this page, click on 'Upgrade to Plus'. </p> 
         <p>You can upgrade from Monthly Premium to Monthly Plus or from Yearly Premium to Yearly Plus. The cost to upgrade is just the different in price, then subsequent billing cycles will be charged the normal subscription rates. If you’ve already used up some time on your subscription before upgrading, we will calculate a prorated price for your upgrade.</p> 
         <p>Premium (monthly): $9.99 USD/ month <br> Premium (yearly): $59.88 USD/ year </p> 
         <p>Plus (monthly): $19 USD/ month <br> Plus (yearly): $110 USD/ year </p> 
         <p>For example, you can upgrade from Monthly Premium to Monthly Plus for $9.01, then your next billing cycle will be charged at the regular price of $19/ month.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can I buy this through a purchase order?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>No, we cannot accept purchase orders for any of the NaturalReader subscription products. We strongly encourage our customers to purchase our subscription products directly from our website whenever possible. Our automatic management system is best suited to handle new registrations for the online NaturalReader products. Unlike the software products wstoch can easily be delivered and paid through various options in a one-off transaction, NaturalReader Online, as a subscription service, requires much more complex management. For this reason, we cannot accept any purchase orders for this version.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Can this translate text?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>No, the application only functions as a text-to-speech tool. The way synthetic text-to-speech voices work is that a specific voice is programmed to emulate the pronunciation conventions of a specific language. So when you're using the application, you have to select a voice to read that corresponds with the language of the text being entered. </p> 
         <p>The voices by themselves are not able to identify what language the text is actually in–so you can use, for example, a French voice to read English text and the effect would simply be that it will read aloud that English text using French language pronunciation.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Are there other languages or voices available with a paid subscription?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Free Voices avialable to you will vary depending on whether you're using a Windows or Mac computer.</p> 
         <p>If you do also use Chrome, some of the voices in the Premium list are Google voices only available to you if you're using a Chrome browser. These voices aren't available for mp3 conversion. </p> 
         <p>We now also offer a new subscription tier 'Plus' that includes access to an additional exclusive list of Plus Voices what also includes languages not available with a Premium subscription.</p> 
         <p>Additional language support with Plus Voices include:</p> 
         <p>English (US, UK, Australian, Indian, Welsh); Danish; Dutch; French (European, Canadian); German; Icelandic; Italian; Norwegian; Polish; Portuguese (European, Brazilian); Romanian; Russian; Spanish (European, US); Swedish; Turkish; and Welsh.</p> 
         <p>All the Premium Voices and Plus Voices are already embedded in the application for you to try out. Free users can sample the Premium voices for up to 20 minutes per day and the Plus Voices for 5 minutes per day. Premium users can also sample the Plus Voices for 5 minutes per day.</p> 
         <p>You can also visit the demo page for more audio samples of the Plus Voices here:</p> 
         <p><a href="./plusvoicedemo.html" id="team6_5">https://www.naturalreaders.com/plusvoicedemo.html</a> </p> 
         <p>Aside from these voice lists, there are no additional 'hidden' voices available with a paid subscription.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Will NaturalReader Online work with Kindle or iBooks? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>No. DRM-protected files such as eBooks from iBooks or Kindle cannot be opened in NaturalReader. The app is capable of reading eBook .epub files, but only if the file is not DRM-protected.</p> 
         <p>DRM “Digital Rights Manage” is a security measure intended to prevent the unauthorized redistribution of digital media. This prevents any third party programs from directly opening DRM-protected content.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Can I read from scanned PDFs or images? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Yes, if you have a subscription. Paid users (Premium or Plus) have access to the OCR feature that converts scanned (inaccessible) PDFs, pictures, images, or screenshots of text into a readible format. OCR is now available with all subscription plans, so if you upload a file needing OCR, the application will do it automatically. Just upload and press play to read.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What is OCR? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>OCR (optical character recognition) is the electronic conversion of printed text into machine-encoded text, such as a scanned document or picture-like image, into a format that would allow NR Online to then extract and read aloud the text in that image. This feature is available with a paid subscription only.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> Can I convert to mp3 files? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>Yes, <b>for personal use only</b> and if you are a paid user. A paid subscription allows you to convert up to 1 million characters per month for mp3 conversion. This limitation only applies when converting text to mp3 files, not for basic text-to-speech when reading directly from the application. This limit applies for both monthly and yearly subscription users and resets the same day the subscription renews. </p> 
         <p>For non-personal use of the mp3 files, please check out the NaturalReader Commercial version, which is a separate platform.</p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What voices can I use to convert to mp3? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>If you use Chrome to use NR Online, some of the voices in the list are Google voices that are accessible only from a Chrome browser. Unfortunately, the Google voices aren't licensed to allow mp3 conversion.</p> 
         <p>Voices not available for mp3 conversion are: US Gabriella, UK Gabriel, UK Grace, SP Anna, SP Mariana, FR Sophia, GR Mia, IT Sofia, PT Carolina, and DT Margreet. </p> 
         <p>All other voices in NR Online may be used for mp3 conversion and are permitted for personal use only. Free users cannot convert to mp3. </p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What is personal use? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>The NR Online application allows you to convert text to downloadable mp3 files for personal use only. </p> 
         <p>Personal use means that only you the individual purchaser may use the application and any generated audio content for your own private use. </p> 
         <p>Audio files created with the personal-use versions cannot be used publicly (including on the internet such as YouTube videos), commercially, <b>or otherwise redistributed in any way.</b></p> 
         <p>Only you may create the audio files for yourself to use privately and not utilized by any other systems or people. </p> 
         <p>Please keep in mind that ‘internal use’ (such as for messaging systems or training videos) or non-profit use nonetheless requires a commercial license to allow <b>redistribution of the audio content.</b> </p> 
         <p>For non-personal use, please see our NaturalReader Commercial version, which is a separate product and platform. </p> 
        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0"> What is the renewal, cancellation, and refund policies? </a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>We strongly recommend that you try before you buy. You can try out all the voices available in the application and some of the basic functions by clicking on the 'Online Reader' button from our homepage or by going to <a href="./online/" id="team6_6">www.naturalreaders.com/online/</a>.</p> 
         <p>Personal use means that only you the individual purchaser may use the application and any generated audio content for your own private use.By default, all subscriptions (Premium or Plus) are set to auto-renew at the end of the billing period. You can turn this off at any time from your account' Billing Information page. After you click on 'Cancel Subscription', paid service will continue until the end of the current billing period without renewal.</p> 
         <p> <b> Cancelling your subscription will not automatically initiate a refund, which is done manually by request only.</b> </p> 
         <p>If you're on a monthly plan, you can request a full refund for up to 14 days after the subscription start/renewal date, or up to 30 days if you have a yearly plan. To request a refund, please <a href="./personalwebfaq.html" id="team6_7">contact us through our website’s help system</a> (click on the blue chat icon in the bottom right corner) and be sure to let us know what email address your subscription is registered with if you're contacting us from a different address.</p> 
         <p>If you're also subscribed to NaturalReader Commercial and wish to cancel subscription that as well, please be sure to login to that version to cancel. Cancelling from NR Online applies to your NR Online subscription only, and vice-versa.</p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>No, NR Online allows only personal use. Personal use does not permit the mp3 files to be redistributed in any way and only allows the individual purchaser private use of such audio files. </p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>If you use Chrome from a Windows, Mac, or Android device, you can also save NR Online to your desktop or mobile’s home screen for quick and easy access.</p> 
         <p>Here’s how:</p> 
         <ol> 
          <li>While using Chrome from a Windows, Mac, or Android device, login to NR Online. </li> 
          <li>If you’re accessing it from the desktop, open the user menu by clicking on ‘More’ in the top right corner or if you’re using Android, open the user menu by tapping the ☰ button in the top left.</li> 
          <li>From the user menu, select ‘Install Application’. A prompt will ask you to confirm, then will install to your device.</li> 
         </ol> 
         <p>If you’re using Android, the app will be saved to your homescreen as an icon just like any other native app.</p> 
         <p>If you’re using a Mac computer, the application will be saved to your Chrome Apps folder, which you can then pin to your Dock for easy access.</p> 
         <p>If you’re using a Windows computer, the application will save automatically to your desktop screen. </p> 
         <p>To delete the app:</p> 
         <p>You can delete it from your Android just like any other native app by holding down on the icon and tapping the 'x' to delete.</p> 
         <p>From either Windows or Mac, open up the NR Online app and click on the ⋮ button in the top right corner, then select ‘Uninstall NaturalReader PWA’.</p> 
         <p>NR Online is a progressive web app, which is still a very new technology so unfortunately the save to homescreen function isn't supported on all kinds of devices or browsers quite yet. </p>

         <p>If your subscription's renewal payment fails, your subscription will not terminate right away and you will still have paid access for a short time in case you need to update your payment information. After the first failed payment, it will try again after 3 days. If you update the payment information within this time, the next renewal attempt will then use the new billing information on file.

        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>When a charge is submitted to your bank or card issuer, they have automated systems that determine whether or not to authorize it. These systems take various signals into account, such as your spending habits, account balance, and card information like the expiration date and CVC.</p> 
         <p>If all of the card information seems correct, it is best to contact your bank and ask for more information. For privacy and security, banks and card issuers can only discuss the specifics of a declined payment with their cardholders–-they cannot discuss this with us.</p>

        </div> </li> 
       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why won't NaturalReader Online read my PDF / Why doesn't it read my PDF correctly?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>PDF 'portable document format' files were originally developed by Adobe in order for users to exchange documents without having formatting problems so that the document and contents look the same no matter what system it's opened with. </p> 
         <p>Because of this, PDFs have a lot of compressed metadata and special encoding that can make it difficult to read from in contrast to other text documents like doc(x). Though the text may look normal to you on the screen, some PDFs may be 'unsearchable' or 'inaccessible'. This means that there's no metadata in the file for what text is actually in the document itself. Instead, it's shown to you as a flat image so for applications like NaturalReader, there's no actual text in the document for the application to extract and read from. </p> 
         <p>Similarly, some PDFs may have 'messy' metadata where the PDF may not have been properly formatted so the effect is inconsistent reading where the voice may read aloud letters or pause in incorrect places. This often occurs with older PDF files. Like with inaccessible PDFs, though the text might look normal on the screen, the text data itself that NR is extracting from the document is not properly formatted in order to allow fluid reading. </p> 
         <p>As of April 2019, the OCR feature is now available with all paid NR Online subscription plans. Now if you upload a scanned document, inaccessible PDF file, or png or jpeg image, the OCR feature will convert it automatically for you after you upload it to the application. You just need to press play to begin reading! </p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>This might occur during temporary server issues. Please wait a few minutes, refresh, and try again. If the problem occurs for more than 20 minutes, please contact us to let us know the problem, in what situation it occurs, and with which voice(s). </p>

        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>It's likely that some of the text in the document is outside of the default reading area. To fix this, you'll need to adjust the reading margins. </p> 
         <p>When you have a document opened in the application, there are icons to the let of the page with additional document settings. Click on the 'Adjust Reading Area' button. Here, you can click and drag the margin settings to increase or decrease the reading area at the top and bottom edges on the page. Lowering the value will increase the area and raising the value will decrease the area. A visual of your document is included in this settings window to help you visualize these changes. </p> 
         <p>When you're done, click on 'Back and Save' and your edits will apply to all of the document's pages. </p>

       <li> <a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why does my text pause at different places when reading directly from the application compared with the mp3 I've converted?</a> 
        <div class="cd-faq-content"> 
         <p>The application processes the text a little bit differently depending on whether you're reading directly from the application or if you're converting to mp3. When the text is converted, it's not able to recognize the paragraph breaks in the same way. So for a sentence that looks like this:</p> 
         <p>Hello! <br> How are you? </p> 
         <p>In the application, it will correctly pause between the lines. But when it is converted to mp3, the spaces aren't able to be registered in the same way and the line break is removed. So the text is that is received for conversion actually looks like this:</p> 
         <p> Hello!How are you? </p> 
         <p>So if you're converting to mp3, please be sure that all periods or commas are followed by a space in this format:</p> 
         <p>Hello! How are you?</p> 
         <p>Rather than using paragraph breaks for pausing.</p>
